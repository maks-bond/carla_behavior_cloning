1. Start Server: `cd /opt/Carla/ && ./CarlaUE4.sh --carla-server`
2. Run client: `python3.8 manual_driving.py`

TODO:
1. Let's eliminate speed feature and eliminate accel label. - DONE
2. Retrain the model. Achieve circular driving behavior. - DONE

Next steps would involve adding behavior to acc, nudge, handle traffic lights, etc.

Next big step option is to perform trajectory classification.
