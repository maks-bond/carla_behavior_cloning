1. Start Server: `CarlaUE4.exe -carla-server`
2. Run client: `py manual_driving.py`

TODO:
1. Collect more data at turns.
2. Figure out how to collect data from autopilot.
3. Use autopilot to record data at turns.
4. Retrain the model. Achieve circular driving behavior.

Once I do the above, I can publish my repo.
I can clean up the code and have a nice Readme.

Next steps would involve adding behavior to acc, nudge, handle traffic lights, etc.

Next big step is to perform trajectory classification.
