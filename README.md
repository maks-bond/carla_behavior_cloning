1. Start Server: `CarlaUE4.exe -carla-server`
2. Run client: `py manual_driving.py`

TODO:
1. Let's eliminate speed feature and eliminate accel label. - DONE
2. Retrain the model. Achieve circular driving behavior. - SOMEWHAT DONE

Once I do the above, I can publish my repo.
I can clean up the code and have a nice Readme.

Next steps would involve adding behavior to acc, nudge, handle traffic lights, etc.

Next big step is to perform trajectory classification.
